    <content type="text"><![CDATA[tags: python Type discipline： habit of A: checking out operators or procedures to see what they do under different circumstances, either check them out or read the specifications of it. habit of B: when you write your own code, you want to be disciplined about what types of arguments or operands you apply to operators. assignment statement: x = 3*5 and y = 15 binding same value. Let z = x give z a pointer to the same place. To the value, not to x. code good style: Don’t change types arbitrarily. The choice of variable names is a great way of commenting your code, use variable names that make sense.]]></content>
